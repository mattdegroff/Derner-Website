								<p>The Progress Project is a collaboration among clinicians, patients, and researchers. We collect data from patients and therapists in a wide range of private practices and mental health clinics. The Progress Project is a collaboration between researchers, clinicians, and patients around the globe. Our main research team is based at Adelphi University, New York. Our goals are to learn about patients’ progress in therapy, understand what makes psychotherapy work, and develop ways to improve treatments and clinical training.</p>

								<h2>Vision</h2>
								<p>Knowing more about your psychotherapy experiences and what really happens in clinical practice will teach us about what types of therapies work best for whom. This will give us ideas about how we might be able to improve the treatments, so that in future therapists can be better trained and more patients can benefit.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-sm-5 wp1">
								<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
								<p>The Progress Project is a partnership of psychotherapy clinicians, patients and researchers. This practice-research-network will help translate research findings into real life clinical practice as well as clinical-practice into research ideas. Learning from you as patients and therapists will ensure that psychotherapy research is as relevant to real life therapy in the community as possible.</p>

								<h2>Values</h2>
								<ol>
									<li>Psychotherapy practice and research improves the wellbeing, quality of life, and mental health of our community</li>
									<li>Patients and therapists have a wealth of knowledge about how, what and when psychotherapy works, and that should inform psychotherapy research.</li>

								<h1>We’re glad that you are interested in The Progress Project.</h2>
								<!--<p>Starting therapy/counseling is not an easy task for most people. We know from our own experience that starting psychotherapy/counseling is not easy and requires a lot of guts. We luckily also know that psychotherapy/counseling is effective for most people in reducing symptoms and increasing overall happiness and satisfaction. In order to make psychotherapy even more effective for a wide variety of people, we need your help!</p>-->
								
								<h2 class="left">What is The Progress Project? </h2>
								<p>Our goal is to understand how people like you progress over the course of their therapy/counseling sessions. We are interested in your experience in therapy and curious about things you find more helpful or beneficial. </p>
								<!--<p>Learning more about your experiences can help us develop a better understanding of what makes psychotherapy work and share these insights with future patients and therapists. </p>-->
								<p>If you choose to join our project, you will be asked to fill out several questionnaires on a regular basis to help us assess your progress over time (more details on that just below).</p>
								
								<h2 class="left">How much time will it take?</h2>
								<ul>
									<li><b>When you enroll for the first time:</b> We will ask you a series of questions, which will take you about 15 minutes. </li>
									<li><b>While you are in therapy/counseling:</b> You could choose the option that fits you best:<br>
										<ol>
											<li><b>5 minutes, once a week:</b> Complete a very brief weekly online survey (5 minutes) after your weekly therapy/counseling session<br>OR<br></li>
											<li><b>20 minutes, once a month:</b> Complete a longer monthly online survey. </li>
										</ol>
									</li>										
									<li><b>10 minutes every 3 months after therapy ended:</b> Complete a 10-minute online survey 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after your therapy ended. </li>
								</ul>
								<p>You don’t have to remember when to go online. If you want you can opt-in to receive email reminders.</p>
													
								<h2 class="left">Can I opt-out of the project at any point?</h2>
								<p>Yes, absolutely, you can opt-out of the project at any point. </p>
								
								<h2 class="left"> Why Should I Participate? </h2>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Help you.</b>The online surveys could help you take a few minutes once a week or once a month to reflect on your experiences in therapy. It might help you to get a better sense of how therapy might be helping you and what areas you are struggling with.</li><br>
									<li><b>Help others.</b><br>Your participation in the project is a significant contribution to the development of better treatments that could benefit other individuals who will be attending therapy/counseling in the future. Your answers will help us produce research that has real-life implications and could make a difference in people’s lives.</li><br>
									<li><b>You might get lucky.</b><br>Each time you complete the online survey, you can choose to enter a bimonthly raffle to win a $50 Amazon gift card. </li><br>

											<div class="panel-body">
												<p>As researchers in The Progress in Mental Health Project, we try to get a better understanding of the experience of therapists and patients in the real world. We would like to know what characterizes therapists in the field and how patients progress over the course of psychotherapy. We like to know what therapy/counseling sessions are really like, about the patient-therapist relationship and what kind of difficulties get better over time.</p>
												<p>Knowing more about your psychotherapy experiences will provide valuable information on what really happens in clinical practice and what types of therapies work best for whom. This will give us ideas about how we might be able to improve the psychotherapy/ counseling that is available, so that in future therapists can be better trained and more patients can benefit.</p>

												<p>The measures that we use to track progress in therapy are not perfect.  Sometimes people report negative change on outcome measures when in fact their symptoms improved or people find that the questions don’t really reflect their experiences.  Likewise, online surveys can never describe the rich complexities of growth and healing in therapy.  Given these limitations, we still think it is important to track your outcomes with these measures. They are one important source of information regarding your progress or deterioration, and can be helpful when you want to reflect on or discuss your experiences with your therapist.</p>
												<p>If there is a measure that you would like to see included, please contact us at <a target=_blank href="mailto: info@myprogressproject.com">info@myprogressproject.com</a></. We are always looking to improve our online surveys, and we want to work closely with therapists and patients to determine which measures or clinical areas are important to incorporate.</p>
